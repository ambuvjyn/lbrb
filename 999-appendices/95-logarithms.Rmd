# Logarithms in R

Logging splits up multiplication into addition.  So, log(m*n) is the same as log(m) + log(n)

You can check this

```{r}
m<-10
n<-11
log(m*n)

log(m)+log(n)

log(m*n) == log(m)+log(n)
```

Exponentiation undos logs

```{r}
exp(log(m*n))
m*n
```

The key equation in BLAST's E values is 

u = ln(K*m*n)/lambda


This can be changed to 

[ln(K) + ln(mn)]/lambda

We can check this

```{r}
K <- 1
m <- 10
n <- 11
lambda <- 110

log(K*m*n)/lambda

(log(K) + log(m*n))/lambda

log(K*m*n)/lambda == (log(K) + log(m*n))/lambda

```



```{r}

```
